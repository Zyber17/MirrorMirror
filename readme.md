# Fairest of Them All

Mirror Mirror is a self-hosted image uploading platform that complies with the [Tweetbot Custom Media Upload specification](http://tapbots.net/tweetbot/custom_media/). Mirror Mirror passes the actual media itself to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and retains a local database of uploaded images along with view counts.
